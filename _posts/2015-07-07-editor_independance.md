I really love working in Vim.
I have customized it so much over the last year,
my fingers have gotten used to all the custom keystroke commands I have made.

It's really difficult to manage when I have to change editor to work on iOS apps.
<br/>**It's like after all the time I have invested in sharpening my axe, they give me an old rusty one with which
to do my work.**
I have tried vim bindings in XCode but it's not the same without all the plugins I use.

So here is my wish.

For Java, I use [eclim](http://eclim.org) and I love it. There is also [Omnisharp tools for .NET](http://www.omnisharp.net/), but I haven't tried it out yet.
<br/>I really love the Swift language. I wish someday, after Swift becomes open source, it's possible to use
Vim to develop iOS apps.
