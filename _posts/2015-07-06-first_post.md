title: My First Blog Post
---

I have been thinking of starting a blog for a while now. I kept searching for a proper theme for the blog.
 I decided to settle for the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) until I can find something better.
The intention of the blog is to update and keep track of the new things I find.
I don't talk a lot and I am ending this post with a quote.
