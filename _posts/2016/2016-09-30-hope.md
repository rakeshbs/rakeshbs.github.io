Hope keeps us inside a non-terminating iteration. It keeps us going even when things take a turn for the worse. The belief
that things will get better tomorrow. I think hope is essential for the survival of all conscious beings.

Will a conscious AI have hope? How will the brain of the AI differ when it doesn't have a dying body and doesn't have to
depend on reproduction for eternal existence.
