>Do you feel a deep sadness when you wake up on certain days? <br/>
>
>Do you feel like today is the day, you will change the world? <br/>
>
>Do you feel helpless at times, seeing all the pain in the world? <br/>
>
>Do you feel an immense desire to save children, when you find them on the strees? <br/>
>
>Do you feel like a hypocrite, someone who is trying to feel superior
just because "your thoughts are so noble"? <br/>
>
>Do you feel you were chosen and you are special? <br/>
>
>Do you hate yourself, because you constantly talk about changing the world and yet do nothing about it? <br/>
>
>Do you live fleeting beautiful moments in your mind, over and over? <br/>
>
>Do you feel like getting lost in a crowd, in a place where noone knows your name?
>
>Do you feel intensely sad because you have to fake love when you are surrounded by it? <br/>
>
>Do you feel your whole projected self is a fake, a sham, just so that you are "liked"?
>
>Do you talk to people hoping you will find that magical connection, the one that stories talk about, only to be disappointed? <br/>
>
>Do you feel like shouting all that is in your brain, hoping someone would hear and understand? <br/>
>
>Do you wake up in cold sweats, haunted by the people you have hurt? <br/>
>
>Do you feel that you have destroyed all the good things that you were lucky to have? <br/>
>
>Do you love/hate yourself at the same time? <br/>
>
>Do you feel guilty that you feel these feelings even though you are privileged? <br/>
>
>If you do, maybe, just maybe, you will understand. <br/>
