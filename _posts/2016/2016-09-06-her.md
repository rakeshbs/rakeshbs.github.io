I loved the movie Her. I think given a choice to have a human or a machine partner like in Her, I would go for the machine. A tweakable, omnipresent listner. Someone who will actually listen to all the bullshit in your head, because it is programmed to do so, and produce intelligent response. Sounds cool now. Waiting for it to be a reality in a few years.
