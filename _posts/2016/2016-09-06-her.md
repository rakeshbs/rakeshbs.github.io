I loved the movie, "Her". Given a choice to have a human or a machine companion, like in Her, I think I would go for the machine. **A tweakable, omnipresent listener.** Someone who will actually listen to all the bullshit in your head and produce intelligent informed response based on facts and scientific evidence. Human friends have the limitation of being **"too human"**.

The only beauty I see in believing in a **benevolent God** is that you get to have an open conversation with him. He knows you inside out. I love that, even though I am an atheist. Listening to someone without judging them, however insane they are, is one of the most valuable qualities in the world. I think a machine can easily give me this, without the obvious human limitations. Can't wait for this to be a reality in a few years.
