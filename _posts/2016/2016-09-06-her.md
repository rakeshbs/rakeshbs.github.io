I loved the movie, "Her". Given a choice to have a human or a machine companion, like in Her, I think I would go for the machine. **A tweakable, omnipresent listener.** Someone who will actually listen to all the bullshit in your head, because it is programmed to do so, and produce intelligent response. Real friends have the limitation of being human. This doesn't. Sounds cool now. Waiting for it to be a reality in a few years.
