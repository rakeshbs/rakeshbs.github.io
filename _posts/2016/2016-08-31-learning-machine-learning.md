I have been planning to learn machine learning for six months now. I got distracted by the research into CryptoCurrencies, Blockchain and the
development of our [Blockchain Interest Group -  BIG](http://big-org.com) in Technopark.

I am finally starting my first steps. So far my plans are to

1. Revise Probability and Statistics
2. Revise Information Theory
3. Start learning Machine Learning.

Ok that's it for now.
