> Once upon a time, I was naive enough to think that I could change the world.

I wanted to be a physicist who worked on the <b>Theory of Everything</b> when I was a kid.

Then I wanted to become one of the best programmers in the world.

I started my company thinking I would change the world.

After learning about the complexities of the world, I found changing it is not an easy task.

I now realise how naive I was, but I think I did more when I was naive.

Maybe naivety is required to keep pushing myself through all the failures.

I am trying to channel my inner naive child now.

Maybe this time around, I will have some success.
