Some say the purpose of life is to have and raise your offspring. Everyone wants to pass on their genes.
Nobody is thinking about the growing population and how we will address the problems that will arise
due to overpopulation.

I see a lot of people spend lot of money on treatments for having children. Why aren't more
people considering adoption? Can one only love, when there is a subset of genes in common to the child?
Are we still trapped by the grip of evolution?

Personally, If I ever want to raise a child, I would go for adoption and not procreation.
