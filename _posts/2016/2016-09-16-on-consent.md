It isn't wrong to feel sexually attracted to the opposite gender. That is how life is sustained on earth. This increasing tendency to label every woman we see with a “sister” tag feels like another way to impose our misogynistic ideals on women. If a girl feels like killing herself after being raped, it is because we give too much importance to the idea of “virginity”, deeming girls impure when they are not virgins.

We need to teach our children what is **consent** and **respect**. All our movies teach us to pester the girl, to whom we are attracted, until she says yes. How is that respect? Rape is just a few steps further.
