Today, I am 30 years old. One of my friends said that it’s a milestone. She got me thinking.

This is a really confusing time in my life.

I am really nostalgic about the past. I feel like going back in time and reliving my childhood. Those memories are so vivid and uncomplicated.

In rare moments, I want to stay right here in time. My relationship with my family and my friends have never been better. There are so many moments, I wish I could freeze and relive all over again. Maybe I will be able to do that in the future.

Then there is the technical side of mine. The side that really wants to see what our collective consciousness will create in the future.

Thinking about my accomplishments, there are none to be really proud of. I was lost without a purpose for sometime. The work I was doing was becoming non challenging and routine and I was starting to get bored of it.

But the last six months were different. I finally found a home for my mind, where it can be constantly challenged. I don’t know how big a contribution I can make in this field but I am really having fun learning it.

My thirst for knowledge has only increased over the years and I am thankful that it did.

I am also thankful to my family and my friends for supporting me during the worst of times and I promise you that the best of times are coming.
