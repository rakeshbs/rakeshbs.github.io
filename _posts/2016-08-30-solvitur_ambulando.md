> Solvitur Ambulando - It is solved by walking.

This is a phrase I picked up from Kochi last month. There was a tiny white board, with the phrase written on it, on a street that had a name I can't remember.

Most of the revelations I have had in my life has happened during one of my solitary walks. And sometimes in the early morning after a good night's sleep. That is why I always say when you are stuck, go to sleep or take a long walk.
