> Solvitur Ambulando - It is solved by walking.

This is a phrase I picked up from Kochi last month. It was early morning. There was a newly constructed pavement for joggers and cyclists on a street with a name I don't remember. There was tiny white board with this phrase written on it. My walking companion translated this for me. It's Latin for "It is solved by walking".

Most of the revelations I have had in my life has happened during one of my solitary walks. And sometimes in the early morning after a good night's sleep. That is why I always say when you are stuck, go to sleep or take a long walk.
